# Write a function, shortest_path that takes in a list of edgges for an undirected graph and two nodes (node_A, node_B). 
# The function should return the length of the shortest path between A and B.
# Consider the length as the number of edges in the path, not the number of nodes. If there is no path between A and B, then return -1.
